			<h1>Adopt-a-Buttler</h1>
			<h2>Good day sir or maddam! May we clean your city's butts?</h2>
			<p>
				Adopt-a-buttler is a solution to cigarette litter.  Our friendly, stylish Buttlers want nothing more than your butts in their faces.  By sponsoring a Buttler in your neighborhood you can support cleaner streets and <a href="http://www.terracycle.com/en-US/brigades/cigarette-waste-brigade.html">turn your butt waste into useful products</a> like ashtrays and toothbrushes.
